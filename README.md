# php-taniguchi
Wrapper for commonly used PHP IMAP functions.

## Description

I had to make a basic Imap client with attachments download, but I didn't find any working projects for my needs.
So i decided to learn how PHP Imap functions work and build an easy-to-use class around them.
The main issue with other project was about attachments download, I don't know why but every library i tried it was downloading only the first attachment.

$tmp->setSsl()->setValidate(false);
```
